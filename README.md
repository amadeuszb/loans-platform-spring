## Loan
Thanks for your interest and congratulation you reach next step in our recuirment process.

You next task is to craft small application with REST API exposed.
 
Application should have ability to create Loan, update value of Loan, close Loan and present current loan to user.
 
Each user should see those values of loan: value, fee, start date and end date.

**Additional requirements:**
* There is no need to have data persisted yet you can do that. 
* We appreaciate tests
* You don't need to finish every single piece of application. If you run of time just leave in the stage you feel comfortable 
* You have one hour to complete it

Good luck
